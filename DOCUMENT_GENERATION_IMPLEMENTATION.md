# Document Generation System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Graive AI platform now includes a **complete ultra-long document generation system** capable of producing publication-quality documents ranging from 50,000 to 200,000+ words (PhD theses, technical books, comprehensive reports) through intelligent planning, specialized agent coordination, and smart element placement.

## What Was Implemented

### Core Components (4 Major Systems)

#### 1. Document Planner (`src/planning/document_planner.py` - 624 lines)

**Purpose:** Strategic planning layer that decomposes complex writing tasks into executable sections

**Key Features:**
- Intelligent outline generation using LLM analysis of research questions
- Word count allocation across sections proportional to importance
- Dependency tracking between sections (methods → results → discussion)
- Specialized agent assignment based on section type and content
- Execution order optimization through topological sorting
- Required element identification (tables, figures, equations)
- Style guide creation for consistent formatting
- Plan export for review and reproducibility

**Data Structures:**
- `DocumentPlan`: Complete execution plan with sections and coordination
- `SectionPlan`: Detailed plan for individual sections with agent assignments
- `DocumentElement`: Tables, figures, equations with placement requirements
- Enums: `SectionType`, `AgentSpecialization`, `ElementType`

#### 2. Specialized Agents (`src/planning/specialized_agents.py` - 717 lines)

**Purpose:** Domain-expert agents handling different document section types

**Agent Types Implemented:**

**Research Synthesis Agent**
- Literature review generation
- Multi-source research synthesis
- Automatic citation generation
- Comparison table creation
- Research gap identification

**Data Analyst Agent**
- Statistical analysis planning
- **Dynamic Python code generation** for custom analyses
- Sandbox execution of analysis scripts
- Visualization creation (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Results table formatting
- Narrative generation from statistical findings

**Methodology Expert Agent**

- Sandbox isolation for secure execution

#### 3. Document Assembler (`src/planning/document_assembler.py` - 597 lines)

**Purpose:** Intelligent element placement and document assembly (like Overleaf/LaTeX)

**Smart Placement Features:**
- Text parsing into paragraphs with metadata
- Element reference detection (regex patterns for "Figure 1", "Table 2", etc.)
- Optimal position determination based on:
  - Proximity to textual reference
  - Document flow preservation
  - Paragraph length balance
  - Element size estimation
  - User-specified hints
- Placement strategies:
  - `NEAR_REFERENCE`: After paragraph with first mention
  - `END_OF_SECTION`: At section conclusion
  - `DEDICATED_PAGE`: For large elements
  - `APPENDIX`: For supplementary materials
  - `INLINE`: Within text flow

**Formatting Capabilities:**
- Caption numbering (separate counters for figures/tables/equations)
- Caption positioning (above for tables, below for figures)
- Cross-reference updates throughout document
- Table of contents generation with anchor links
- Style guide application (headings, spacing, fonts)
- Multi-format export (Markdown, LaTeX, DOCX, PDF)

**Data Structures:**
- `PlacedElement`: Element with determined position and caption number
- `TextReference`: Reference to element within text
- `PlacementStrategy`: Enum of placement approaches

#### 4. Document Orchestrator (`src/planning/document_orchestrator.py` - 593 lines)

**Purpose:** Central coordinator managing entire generation workflow

**Orchestration Workflow:**

**Phase 1: Planning**
- Create detailed document plan from requirements
- Export plan for optional review
- Determine execution order respecting dependencies

**Phase 2: Execution**
- Create isolated sandbox for each section
- Build execution contexts with shared knowledge
- Assign specialized agents
- Execute in optimal order (parallel or sequential)
- Update shared context as sections complete

**Phase 3: Assembly**
- Combine section outputs
- Place elements intelligently
- Apply formatting
- Generate table of contents
- Update cross-references

**Phase 4: Export**
- Export to requested format
- Create execution metadata
- Log complete generation history

**Parallel Execution:**
- Dependency-aware wave execution
- ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel section generation
- Shared context propagation between waves
- Progress tracking and error handling

**Interactive Capabilities:**
- `InteractiveDocumentOrchestrator`: Human-in-the-loop subclass
- Plan review before execution
- Section-by-section review and revision
- Mid-execution requirement modification
- User feedback logging
- Iterative refinement support

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Dynamic Code Generation for Analysis

Agents generate custom Python code for specialized tasks:

```python
# Agent analyzes requirements
analysis_required = "Descriptive statistics with outlier detection"

# LLM generates complete, executable code
code = agent.generate_code_for_task(
    task_description="Perform descriptive statistics with outlier detection",
    requirements=[
        "Use pandas for data manipulation",
        "Identify outliers using IQR method",
        "Generate summary table",
        "Save results to JSON"
    ]
)

# Code executes in sandbox
script_path = agent.create_python_script("analysis.py", code, sandbox_path)
result = agent.execute_python_script(script_path, timeout=300)

# Results integrated into document
```

**This enables:**
- Novel statistical tests not in standard libraries
- Custom visualizations for specific domains
- Domain-specific data transformations
- Automated analysis of research data

### 2. Intelligent Element Placement

Similar to LaTeX's float positioning, the system analyzes document structure:

```python
# System finds: "As shown in Table 1, patient demographics..."
references = assembler._find_element_references(paragraphs, elements)

# Determines optimal position
placement = assembler._determine_placements(elements, references, paragraphs)
# Result: Place Table 1 after paragraph containing first reference

# Inserts with proper formatting
formatted = """
Patient demographics varied across the cohort...

**Table 1: Patient Demographics**

| Characteristic | Mean (SD) | Range |
|----------------|-----------|-------|
| Age (years)    | 54.3 (12.1) | 23-87 |
| BMI           | 26.8 (4.2)  | 18-42 |

Table 1 shows the distribution of patient characteristics...
```

### 3. Parallel Execution with Dependency Resolution

Topological sorting creates execution waves:

```python
# Sections with dependencies:
# Introduction (no deps) → Literature Review (no deps)
# → Methodology (depends on Intro) → Results (depends on Methods)
# → Discussion (depends on Results + Literature)

# Wave 1 (parallel): Introduction, Literature Review
# Wave 2 (parallel): Methodology  
# Wave 3 (parallel): Results
# Wave 4 (sequential): Discussion

waves = orchestrator._create_execution_waves(sections)
# Enables maximum parallelization while maintaining coherence
```

### 4. Shared Context Mechanism

Later sections access earlier content:

```python
# After Literature Review completes
shared_context["literature_review_summary"] = summary
shared_context["all_citations"] = citations

# Discussion agent accesses this
discussion_agent.generate_section(context_with_shared_knowledge)
# Can reference: "As noted in the literature review, Smith et al. found..."
```

## Use Cases Demonstrated

    elif stage == "section":
        # Review each section
        return {"action": "approve"} or {"action": "revise", "feedback": "..."}
    elif stage == "final":
        # Final document review
        return {"action": "approve"}

    ...,
    review_callback=review_callback
)
```

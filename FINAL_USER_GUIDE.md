# 🎯 GRAIVE AI - Complete User Guide (All Fixes Applied)

## 🔥 What's New

Your Graive AI has been completely overhauled to fix the critical "chat mode fallback" issue. The system now **actually executes tasks** instead of just talking about them.

### Critical Fixes Applied

1. ✅ **Image insertion now works** - "insert it into the essay u made" now creates actual files
2. ✅ **Document tracking** - System remembers the last essay/document you created
3. ✅ **Session workspaces** - Each conversation gets its own organized folder
4. ✅ **CLI file operations** - Create, delete, rename, edit files programmatically
5. ✅ **Enhanced detection** - Understands "it", "that", "the essay u made", etc.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
cd "c:\Users\GEMTECH 1\Desktop\GRAIVE"
python graive.py
```

You'll see:
```
📁 Session Workspace: workspace\session_20251026_142835
   All files for this session will be organized here

I can:
  • Write essays, articles, and research papers with citations
  • Generate images (flags, graphics) and insert them into documents
  • Generate code (Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.) to actual files
  • Create PowerPoint presentations
  • Analyze data (with pandas/matplotlib)
  • Create, delete, rename, edit files (CLI operations)
  • Remember our conversation context
  • Execute complex multi-step tasks
```

✅ IMAGE GENERATED WITH AI
📄 File: ai_generated_uganda_wars_20251026_142351.png
📍 Location: workspace\session_20251026_142835\images\...

💡 Tip: You can now insert this image into a document!

### Scenario 3: Natural Language Variations

The system now understands many ways to say the same thing:

**Image Insertion** - All these work now:
- ✅ "insert it into the essay u made"
- ✅ "insert it into the essay you made"
- ✅ "add it to the document"
- ✅ "put it in that article"
- ✅ "include the image in the essay"
- ✅ "embed it in the paper"

**Document References** - All these work:
- ✅ "the essay u made"
- ✅ "that document"
- ✅ "the article you created"
- ✅ "that paper"

## 📁 Workspace Organization

### Before (BROKEN)
```
workspace/
├── documents/
│   ├── essay1.md           ← Session 1
│   ├── essay2.md           ← Session 2
│   ├── essay3.md           ← Session 1
│   └── essay4.md           ← Session 3
├── images/
│   ├── image1.png          ← Session 2
│   └── image2.png          ← Session 1
└── code/
    └── game.py             ← Session 3
```
❌ **Problem**: Files from different sessions all mixed together!

### After (FIXED)
```
workspace/
├── session_20251026_142835/    ← Your first chat
│   ├── documents/
│   │   ├── uganda_wars.md
│   │   └── AI_essay.md
│   ├── images/
│   │   └── uganda_wars.png
│   └── code/
│       └── snake_game.py
├── session_20251026_153042/    ← Your second chat
│   ├── documents/
│   │   └── climate_report.md
│   └── images/
│       └── earth.png
└── session_20251026_164521/    ← Your third chat
    └── code/
        └── calculator.py
```
✅ **Solution**: Each conversation gets its own isolated folder!

## 🔧 CLI File Operations (NEW!)

The system now has full file management capabilities:

### Available Operations

| Operation | What It Does | Example Use |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Create File | Creates new file with content | Meeting notes |
| Delete File | Removes file | Delete old draft |
| Rename File | Changes filename or moves file | Rename to final version |
| Edit File | Modifies file contents | Add conclusion |
| Create Folder | Makes new directory | Organize by topic |
| Delete Folder | Removes directory | Clean up |
| List Files | Shows directory contents | See all essays |
| Copy File | Duplicates file | Create backup |

These operations happen automatically when needed by the system.

---

## 📊 Session Tracking

### What Gets Tracked

During your conversation, the system remembers:

1. **Last Generated Image** - `self.last_generated_image`
   - Path to most recently created image
   - Used when you say "insert it" or "that image"

2. **Last Generated Document** - `self.last_generated_document`
   - Path to most recently created essay/article
   - Used when you say "the essay u made" or "that document"

3. **Last Generated Code** - `self.last_generated_code`
   - Path to most recently created code file
   - Future use for code editing

### Reference Detection

When you say things like:
- "the essay u made" → System finds last document
- "that image" → System finds last image
- "insert it" → System understands context

Example:
```
You: generate image of japan flag
[System tracks: last_generated_image = "flag_of_japan.png"]

You: write essay about japan
[System tracks: last_generated_document = "japan_essay.md"]

You: insert it into the essay u made
[System uses BOTH tracked values to insert image into document!]
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 1. Session Workspace Location

Every time you run `python graive.py`, a NEW session folder is created:
```
workspace/session_20251026_142835/  ← First run today
workspace/session_20251026_153042/  ← Second run today
workspace/session_20251026_164521/  ← Third run today
```

**Each session is completely isolated** - files won't mix between conversations.

### 2. Finding Your Files

At the start of each session, you'll see:
```
📁 Session Workspace: workspace\session_20251026_142835
   All files for this session will be organized here
```

All your files are in that folder!

### 3. Task Detection Order

The system checks for tasks in this order:
1. Code generation → "code me..."
2. Data analysis → "analyze..."
3. PPT creation → "create powerpoint..."
4. **Image insertion** → "insert it..."
5. Image generation → "give me image..."
6. Document generation → "write essay..."
7. Chat (fallback) → Everything else

### 4. Execution vs Chat

**Before the fixes**:
- System detected task → ❌ Chatted about it
- "I'll insert the image..." → ❌ No file created

**After the fixes**:
- System detects task → ✅ Actually executes it
- Progress tracking shown → ✅ File created

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "insert it into the essay u made" still chats

**Fix**: Make sure you:
1. Generated an image FIRST
2. Generated an essay SECOND  
3. Then say "insert it into the essay u made"

The system needs both to exist before insertion.

### Issue: Can't find my files

**Check**: Look in the session workspace shown at startup:
```
📁 Session Workspace: workspace\session_20251026_142835
```

Your files are in:
- `session_20251026_142835/documents/` - Essays, articles
- `session_20251026_142835/images/` - Images
- `session_20251026_142835/code/` - Code files

### Issue: System says "Task executor not available"

**Fix**: Restart Graive AI. The task executor initializes on startup.

### Issue: System creates placeholder instead of actual content

**Check**: Ensure you have API keys in `.env`:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Without API keys, the system can't generate content.

## ✅ Verification Checklist

To verify all fixes are working:

- [ ] Run `python graive.py`
- [ ] See "Session Workspace" message
- [ ] Say "generate image of uganda wars"
- [ ] See actual image created in session folder
- [ ] Say "write essay about uganda conflicts"
- [ ] See actual essay created in session folder
- [ ] Say "insert it into the essay u made"
- [ ] See "[📄 Detected reference to last document...]" message
- [ ] See new document file created with image embedded
- [ ] Check session folder - all 3 files present

## 🎉 Summary

Your Graive AI is now:
- ✅ **Execution-based** (not chat-based)
- ✅ **Context-aware** (remembers last document/image)
- ✅ **Session-organized** (each chat has its own folder)
- ✅ **CLI-capable** (create, delete, rename, edit files)
- ✅ **Flexible** (understands "it", "that", "the essay u made")

**The exact scenario you reported is now fixed!**

Try it out:
```bash
python graive.py

You: generate image about uganda wars
You: write essay about uganda conflicts  
You: insert it into the essay u made
```

You'll see actual file creation with progress tracking! 🚀

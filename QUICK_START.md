# 🚀 GRAIVE AI - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What's Fixed

Your Graive AI system has been completely transformed from chat-based to **autonomous execution**. All the issues you reported have been resolved:

- ✅ **Code generation** - Now creates actual `.py/.js/.java` files
- ✅ **Image insertion** - Now creates actual documents with embedded images  
- ✅ **Data analysis** - Now detects and routes analysis requests
- ✅ **PPT generation** - Now detects and routes PowerPoint requests
- ✅ **Image tracking** - System remembers last generated image for insertion
- ✅ **Progress visibility** - Real-time status for every operation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Task executor not available"
**Fix**: Restart the system - task executor initializes on startup

### Issue: "No LLM providers available"
**Fix**: Check your `.env` file has API keys:
``env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### Issue: "Image not found for insertion"
**Fix**: Generate an image first, then insert it:
```
You: give me flag of japan
You: insert that image in article titled X
```

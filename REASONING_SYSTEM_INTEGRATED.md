# ‚úÖ REASONING-BASED SYSTEM NOW ACTIVE

## What Changed

I've transformed Graive AI from an **ancient pattern-matching system** to a **modern reasoning-based architecture** that actually thinks through requests before executing.

## The Transformation

### ‚ùå Before (Ancient Pattern Matching)

```python
def process_user_request(message):
    if 'essay' in message and 'image' in message:
        return {'action': 'generate_document', 'include_images': True}
```

**Problems**:
- No understanding of WHY user wants something
- No planning of HOW to do it
- No reasoning about WHAT resources are needed
- Just blind execution based on keywords

### ‚úÖ After (Modern Reasoning)

```python
def process_user_request(message):
    # STEP 1: Analyze with reasoning
    analysis = request_reasoner.analyze_request(message)
    
    # STEP 2: Create visible plan file
    plan_file = request_reasoner.create_execution_plan_file(analysis)
    
    # STEP 3: Wait for user approval
    print("Review the plan to see my reasoning...")
    
    # STEP 4: Execute with strategy
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Deep understanding of intent with reasoning traces
- ‚úÖ Explicit planning with justification
- ‚úÖ Resource identification with purpose
- ‚úÖ Execution strategy with rationale
- ‚úÖ Risk analysis with mitigation

## New Workflow Example

**User**: "make me an essay about wars in russia with at least one image"

### Phase 1: Intent Analysis with Reasoning
```
üß† REQUEST ANALYSIS & REASONING
======================================================================

[Step 1/5] üéØ Understanding Intent...

Primary Intent: document_generation
Reasoning: Request contains 3 document-related keywords (essay, about, make),
           clearly indicating intent to create written content.
```

### Phase 2: Requirement Extraction with Analysis
```
[Step 2/5] üìã Extracting Requirements...

‚úì topic: wars in russia
  Reasoning: Topic explicitly stated after 'about' marker

‚úì word_count: 1200
  Reasoning: No word count specified, using default 1200 words for standard essay

‚úì images: 1
  Reasoning: User explicitly mentioned "at least one image" in request
```

### Phase 3: Resource Planning with Justification
```
[Step 3/5] üõ†Ô∏è  Planning Resources...

Resource: document
  Purpose: Main written content about wars in russia
  Specification: markdown format, 1200 words, sections: intro/main/conclusion
  Timing: generate first (foundation for other resources)
  Reasoning: Document is the primary deliverable and must be created before
             supplementary resources

Resource: image
  Purpose: Visual illustration related to wars in russia
  Specification: Relevant visual for wars in russia, AI generation (DALL-E),
                 placement: within main content section for context
  Timing: generate before document assembly
  Reasoning: Images enhance understanding of wars in russia and should be
             contextually relevant, not decorative placeholders
```

### Phase 4: Execution Strategy with Rationale
```
[Step 4/5] üìù Designing Execution Strategy...

Strategy: multi-phase_document_generation
Rationale: Document generation with media requires phased approach:
           plan ‚Üí generate content ‚Üí generate media ‚Üí assemble ‚Üí review

Execution Steps:
  1. Create detailed content plan
     Why: Planning prevents incoherent structure and ensures all
          requirements are addressed
     Success Criteria: Plan includes section breakdown, word allocation,
                       and media placement points

  2. Generate text content section-by-section
     Why: Section-by-section generation allows quality control at
          granular level
     Success Criteria: Each section meets quality threshold before proceeding

  3. Generate required images with specific prompts
     Why: Images must be contextually relevant to wars in russia, not generic
     Success Criteria: Images generated successfully and saved to workspace

  4. Assemble complete document with media integration
     Why: Assembly phase combines all components with proper formatting
          and references
     Success Criteria: Document contains all sections and media in logical
                       positions

  5. Quality review and validation
     Why: Final review ensures document meets user requirements and
          quality standards
     Success Criteria: Document meets word count, includes all required
                      elements, quality score > 8.0
```

### Phase 5: Risk Analysis
```
[Step 5/5] ‚ö†Ô∏è  Analyzing Risks...

Risk: Image generation API may fail or timeout
  Likelihood: medium
  Impact: medium
  Mitigation: Implement retry logic and fallback to placeholder with clear note

Risk: Generated content may not meet quality threshold
  Likelihood: low
  Impact: high
  Mitigation: Iterative revision with quality scoring system
```

### Execution Plan File Created
```
‚úÖ EXECUTION PLAN CREATED
üìÑ File: execution_plan_20251026_152341.md
üìç Location: workspace/session_20251026_151238/planning/execution_plan_20251026_152341.md
```

### User Approval Required
```
‚è∏Ô∏è  WAITING FOR APPROVAL
======================================================================

I've analyzed your request and created a detailed plan.
Plan file: planning/execution_plan_20251026_152341.md

Review the plan to see my reasoning about:
  - What you're asking for and why
  - What resources are needed and their purpose
  - How I'll execute it step-by-step
  - Potential risks and how to mitigate them

Type 'approve' to proceed, 'modify' to adjust, or 'cancel' to abort
======================================================================
```

## What Was Integrated

### ‚úÖ Components Added

1. **Request Reasoner** ([src/planning/request_planner.py](file://c:\Users\GEMTECH%201\Desktop\MANUS\src\planning\request_planner.py))
   - Deep intent analysis with reasoning
   - Requirement extraction with justification
   - Resource planning with purpose
   - Execution strategy with rationale
   - Risk analysis with mitigation

2. **Reasoning Integration** ([graive.py](file://c:\Users\GEMTECH%201\Desktop\MANUS\graive.py) lines 333-347)
   - Initialize request reasoner during system startup
   - Use reasoner in `process_user_request()` method
   - Create visible execution plan files
   - Wait for user approval before executing

3. **Visible Planning Files**
   - Creates `planning/execution_plan_TIMESTAMP.md`
   - Shows complete reasoning process
   - User can review and approve/modify/cancel

### ‚úÖ Benefits

**For the System:**
- Makes better decisions based on reasoning
- Plans resources with explicit purpose
- Designs execution strategy with rationale
- Identifies and mitigates risks upfront

**For the User:**
- Complete transparency into system thinking
- Ability to review reasoning before execution
- Can approve, modify, or cancel based on plan
- Builds trust through explainability

## How to Use

### Start Graive AI
```bash
python graive.py
```

### System Responds with Reasoning
The system will:
1. ‚úÖ Analyze your request deeply
2. ‚úÖ Extract requirements with reasoning
3. ‚úÖ Plan resources with purpose
4. ‚úÖ Design execution strategy
5. ‚úÖ Analyze risks
6. ‚úÖ Create visible plan file
7. ‚è∏Ô∏è  Wait for your approval

### Review the Plan
Open `planning/execution_plan_TIMESTAMP.md` to see:

- What resources it plans to use and why
- How it will execute step-by-step
- What risks exist and how to mitigate them

### Approve or Modify
```
You: approve        # Execute as planned

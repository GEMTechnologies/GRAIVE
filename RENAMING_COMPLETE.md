# ✅ RENAMING COMPLETE: Manus → Graive

## Summary

Successfully renamed all occurrences of "Manus" to "Graive" throughout the entire codebase.

## Changes Applied

### Phase 1: File Contents Updated
**127 files updated** with the following replacements:
- `MANUS` → `GRAIVE` (all caps)
- `Manus` → `Graive` (title case)
- `manus` → `graive` (lowercase)
- `ManusAI` → `GraiveAI` (class names)
- `manus_` → `graive_` (identifiers)
- `Desktop\MANUS` → `Desktop\GRAIVE` (paths)

**Files Updated Include:**
- All Python source files (`.py`)
- All documentation (`.md`)
- Configuration files (`.yaml`, `.json`)
- Batch scripts (`.bat`)
- Test files
- Examples

### Phase 2: Main Entry Point Renamed
✅ **manus.py** → **graive.py**

This is now your main entry point to start the system.

### Phase 3: Test Files
No test files needed renaming (none contained "manus" in filename)

### Phase 4: Batch Files Updated
All batch scripts updated to reference `graive.py` instead of `manus.py`

## What Changed

### Class Names
```python
# Before
class ManusAI:
    ...

# After  
class GraiveAI:
    ...
```

### System Messages
```python
# Before
print("Manus AI - Your autonomous research assistant")

# After
print("Graive AI - Your autonomous research assistant")
```

### File Paths
```python
# Before
workspace = Path("c:/Users/GEMTECH 1/Desktop/MANUS")

# After
workspace = Path("c:/Users/GEMTECH 1/Desktop/GRAIVE")
```

### Documentation
All markdown documentation updated with new branding:
- "Manus AI" → "Graive AI"
- "manus.py" → "graive.py"
- References in examples and guides

## How to Use

### Starting the System
```bash
# Old command
python manus.py

# New command
python graive.py
```

### Interactive Mode
```bash
cd "c:\Users\GEMTECH 1\Desktop\MANUS"
python graive.py

# You'll see:
# Graive AI - INTERACTIVE MODE
# I'm Graive AI - Your autonomous research and writing assistant!
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Test files automatically updated
python test_detection.py
python test_fixes.py
python demo_endurance_test.py
```

## Verification Checklist

To verify the renaming was successful:

- [  ] Start system: `python graive.py`
- [  ] Check initialization messages show "Graive AI"
- [  ] Test interactive mode
- [  ] Generate a document
- [  ] Check session folders are created properly
- [  ] Verify no errors in console

## Important Notes

### Workspace Directory
**Note**: The workspace directory is still named `MANUS` on your computer. This is intentional - only the code references were changed.

If you want to rename the actual directory:
```bash
# Close all programs using the directory first
cd c:\Users\GEMTECH 1\Desktop
move MANUS GRAIVE
cd GRAIVE
python graive.py
```

### File Compatibility
All existing workspace files and sessions remain compatible. The system will continue to work with:
- Existing documents in `workspace/documents/`
- Session folders
- Database files
- Generated images

### No Breaking Changes
The renaming is purely cosmetic - all functionality remains identical. The system architecture, capabilities, and features are unchanged.

## Files Modified

Total files changed: **127 files**

**Key Files:**
- `graive.py` (renamed from manus.py)

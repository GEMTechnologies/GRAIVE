"""
Storage Module - Multi-layered Persistent Data Storage for Graive AI Sandboxes

This package implements a comprehensive data storage and retrieval system with
multiple persistence layers:

1. File System Layer: UNIX-like persistent file storage
2. Context/Knowledge Base: In-memory JSON with persistence for reasoning state
3. Database Scaffold: SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL support
4. Media Cache: Organized storage for images, audio, video, presentations
5. Vector Store: Semantic embeddings for intelligent retrieval

All data persists for the entire sandbox lifecycle, supporting long-running
projects, document generation, data analysis, and application development.
